Part 2:  
First Split (double_split): [index.html](https://nadagehad01.github.io/Lab10/)  
Second Split (dark_color): [secondSplit.html](https://nadagehad01.github.io/Lab10/secondSplit.html)  

For secondSplit, we change the background color to dark yellow (at 'on') and we change the background color to darker yellow (at 'off'). Both happen for 100% of our users. The rules include 'on' being 50% of the times and 'off' being the other 50% of the times. Default and baseline treatments are set to 'on'.
